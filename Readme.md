# DES Cracking Project

Currently there are three implementations:

1. A mostly integer-math one by Gabe
2. A mostly bitfield-math one, reworked from the above
3. One by Julia, where she will fill in a description here. -- my_des.py is a very long implementation that I think works. You use it by changing the values for key and string in __main__

Up next is to make a cracking script, given the constraints that the other teams give us.
