# DES Cracking Project

Currently there are three implementations:

1. A mostly integer-math one by Gabe
2. A mostly bitfield-math one, reworked from the above
3. One by Julia, where she will fill in a description here

Up next is to make a cracking script, given the constraints that the other teams give us.
